Static Cast:

Compile-time cast
Int to Float (vv)
Int to Double (vv)
Pointer to void* (vv)

static_cast<dest_type>( source );


Dynamic Cast:

Mainly used for safe downcasting during run time

static_cast<new_type>( Expression );


Const Cast:

Used to cast away the constness of variables


Reinterpret Cast:

It is used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of another data type, even if the data types before and after conversion are different.

data_type *var_name = reinterpret_cast <data_type *>(pointer_variable);

1. vector: A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.

2. list: A doubly-linked list that allows efficient insertion and removal of elements.

3. deque: A double-ended queue, similar to a vector but allowing efficient insertion and removal at both ends.

4. set: A container that stores unique elements in sorted order.

5. map: A container that stores key-value pairs and allows efficient look-up by key.

6. multiset: Similar to a set, but allows duplicates.

7. multimap: Similar to a map, but allows multiple elements with the same key.

8. stack: Implements a stack data structure with LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior.

9. queue: Implements a queue data structure with FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.

10. priority_queue: Implements a priority queue, typically used with a heap data structure.

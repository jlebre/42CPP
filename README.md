## 📌 Overview

The **42 C++ Modules** is a series of exercises designed to introduce students to object-oriented programming in C++.
The goal is to learn the core concepts of the language, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, templates, and more.

This project is part of the **42 curriculum**, covering modern C++ development practices.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository contains the following modules:

- [**Module 00**](./CPP00): Basics of C++ (namespaces, I/O streams, classes, member functions, and the Orthodox Canonical Form).
- [**Module 01**](./CPP01): Memory allocation, references, pointers, and file handling.
- [**Module 02**](./CPP02): Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the `Fixed` class.
- [**Module 03**](./CPP03): Inheritance in C++.
- [**Module 04**](./CPP04): Abstract classes and interfaces (pure virtual functions).
- [**Module 05**](./CPP05): Exception handling.
- [**Module 06**](./CPP06): Casts in C++.
- [**Module 07**](./CPP07): Templates in C++.
- [**Module 08**](./CPP08): The Standard Template Library (STL).
- [**Module 09**](./CPP09): Containers and algorithms.

Each module contains multiple exercises, incrementally increasing in complexity.
